# Q Election Votes

Q election votes is one tool of the Q toolbox to display results of parliamentary elections.

## Example
Here is what the tool looks like on mobile and other devices. The example shows intermediate results of the elections in the Netherlands 2017. It's in German because we do not have multilanguage support (yet).
