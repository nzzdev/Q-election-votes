When changing or implementing...

## Deployment

We provide automatically built docker images at https://hub.docker.com/r/nzzonline/q-election-votes/.
There are three options for deployment:

- Use the provided images
- Build your own docker images
- Deploy the service using another technology

### Use the provided docker images

1. Deploy `nzzonline/q-election-votes` to a docker environment

## Functionality

Here is what the tool looks like on mobile and other devices. The example shows intermediate results of the elections in the Netherlands in 2017. It's in German because we do not have multilanguage support (yet).

![Election results as shown on mobile](https://github.com/nzzdev/Q-election-votes/blob/master/readme-images/votes_mob.png)

Each graphic has the following three sections:

- Header: contains specified title and subtitle
- Main Part: displays results for each party including the trend compared to last elections and - if present - a threshold line indicating if a party will be part of the parliament. Parties are sorted by percentage value.
- Footer: contains further notes (e.g. how many municipalities already finished counting), source(s) and update information

The tool structure follows the general structure of each Q tool. Further information can be found in [Q server documentation - Developing tools](https://nzzdev.github.io/Q-server/developing-tools.html).

There is only one endpoint to get `renderingInfo` in this tool:

### `/rendering-info/html-static`

This endpoint returns a renderingInfo object with static HTML/CSS/SVG that is fully responsive.

### Options

#### hideUpdatedDate

This option is only available for users with the `expert-election-votes` roles. It hides the updated date and is mainly used when you enter historic data where the last updated date makes no sense.

#### Display options

##### hideTitle

If checked the title doesn't get rendered.
