# Q Election Votes

**Maintainer**: [benib](https://github.com/benib)

Q election votes is one tool of the Q toolbox to display results of parliamentary elections.

## Example
Here is what the tool looks like on mobile and other devices. The example shows intermediate results of the elections in the Netherlands in 2017. It's in German because we do not have multilanguage support (yet).

Each graphic has the following three sections:
- Header: contains specified title and subtitle
- Main Part: displays results for each party including the trend compared to last elections and - if present - a threshold line indicating if a party will be part of the parliament. Parties are sorted by percentage value.
- Footer: contains further notes (e.g. how many municipalities already finished counting), source(s) and update information

## Implementation details
The tool structure follows the general structure of each Q tool. Further information can be found in [Q server documentation - Developing tools](https://nzzdev.github.io/Q-server/developing-tools.html).
